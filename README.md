## Installations
This code has a number of required dependencies which have to be pre-installed to work. They include:
- pandas
- numpy
- sklern
- matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn
- statsmodels
- scipy.stats
- tabulate

This project used a dataset that was obtained from the Health Nutrition and Population Statistics dataset from the [World Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/health-nutrition-and-population-statistics). To ensure that the dataset can be replicated, the offline version of the data is included in the '/data/raw' folder. This file is in CSV format.
## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to take a data science approach to understanding the key predictors of life expectancy and offer insights into priorities for policymakers to help them maximise their impact on public health.
## Files
- Lower_Middle_DataBank_Health_Nutrition_and_Population_Statistics.csv (CSV file: data to use)
- life_expectancy_in_lower_middle_income_countries_final (Jupyter notebook: includes code used to run the analysis)
## Usage
- Download data before use as stated in the installation instructions.
- Code is commented and split into clear sections.
